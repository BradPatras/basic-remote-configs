# basic-remote-configs  üìù
Bare-bones remote config platform for android and iOS.  Motivation for this project is having simple remote configs in my app projects where pulling in Firebase would be overkill.

#### Android library repo: [brc-android](https://www.github.com/BradPatras/brc-android)
#### iOS library repo: `// todo`

## Spec
Configs are in JSON format. Compatible data types include `integer`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, and `array(integer|string|boolean)`. Nested objects are not supported.

Example of config format
```json
{
  "ver": 1,
  "exampleFlag": true,
  "exampleMessage": null
}
```
`ver` is an integer value representing the config file's version. It's not required, but the client libraries use this value to publish only updates to listeners after fetching configs.

## In practice
This repo is hosting an [example config json file](/examples/simple.json). This example config is currently being consumed by the [Android Library's](https://github.com/BradPatras/brc-android) sample app. 

‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp; In the current state of the library, config files need to be publicly accessible. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
